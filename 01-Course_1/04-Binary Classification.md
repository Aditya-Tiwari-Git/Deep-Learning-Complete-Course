This week, we're diving into the **basics of neural network programming** 🧠💻. Some key techniques will be covered, like avoiding explicit loops over training examples and using more efficient methods for neural networks 🚀. You'll also learn about **forward propagation** and **backward propagation**, two crucial steps in neural network computation 🔄.

To make these concepts more accessible, we'll start with **logistic regression**, which is used for **binary classification** (e.g., determining if an image is a cat 🐱 or not-cat ❌). Here's how it works:

1. **Image Representation**: A 64x64 image has three 64x64 matrices for **red**, **green**, and **blue** pixels 🎨. These are combined into a **feature vector**, which we denote as **x**.
   
   - For a 64x64 image, this results in a vector of **12,288 values** (64 * 64 * 3 = 12,288) 🔢.

2. **Goal**: The aim is to train a classifier that takes this feature vector **x** and predicts **y** (1 for cat, 0 for not-cat) 📊.

3. **Training Set**: A training set consists of **m** examples, each represented as (x, y) pairs 📝. For the entire training set:
   
   - **X** is a matrix with the **x** vectors as columns 🏛️.
   - **Y** is a 1xM matrix with the **y** labels stacked in columns 📑.

4. **Notations**:
   - **nx** is the dimension of the input features **x** (12,288 in this case) 🧮.
   - **m** is the number of training examples.
   - **X** is an nx by m matrix.
   - **Y** is a 1 by m matrix.

By organizing the data this way, it becomes easier to implement the **logistic regression algorithm** and later **neural networks** ⚙️.

In the next video, we'll dive deeper into how logistic regression works with this notation ✍️.
