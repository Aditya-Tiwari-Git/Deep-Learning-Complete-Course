### Notes for Revision: Neural Networks and Their Economic Impact 🧠💼

1. **Hype Around Neural Networks**:
   - Neural networks are receiving a lot of attention, and **supervised learning** has been the main driver of economic value so far 📊.
   - Supervised learning involves learning a function that maps **input (x)** to **output (y)**, like predicting housing prices based on features 🏠.

2. **Key Applications of Neural Networks**:
   - **Online Advertising**: Neural networks predict whether users will click on ads based on input data. This is one of the most lucrative uses, directly affecting the **bottom line** for advertising companies 💰.
   - **Computer Vision**: Deep learning has significantly advanced this field, enabling **photo tagging** and **image recognition** 📸.
   - **Speech Recognition**: Converts audio into text using neural networks 🗣️.
   - **Machine Translation**: Neural networks now translate languages more effectively, such as **English to Chinese** 🌍.
   - **Autonomous Driving**: Neural networks process images and radar data to identify the positions of cars, contributing to self-driving technology 🚗.

3. **Types of Neural Networks**:
   - **Standard Neural Networks**: Used in applications like real estate predictions and online ads 🏡📊.
   - **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Best for image data, commonly used in computer vision tasks 📷.
   - **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: Effective for **sequence data**, such as audio or language, which have a temporal component 🎧📜.

4. **Structured vs. Unstructured Data**:
   - **Structured Data**: Data with clear, defined features, like house size or user age in ad predictions. Neural networks handle this very effectively 🗃️.
   - **Unstructured Data**: More complex data like audio, images, or text where features are less defined. Neural networks have become much better at interpreting this data 🎨🖼️.
   
5. **Impact of Neural Networks on Unstructured Data**:
   - Neural networks have transformed how computers understand **unstructured data**, allowing breakthroughs in **speech recognition, image recognition**, and **natural language processing** 🧑‍💻.
   - This creates **new opportunities** for applications that were previously difficult to achieve 🌟.

6. **Economic Value in Structured Data**:
   - Though unstructured data receives more media attention (e.g., recognizing a cat 🐱), neural networks have also greatly improved structured data applications like **advertising systems** and **product recommendations** 📈.

7. **The Rise of Neural Networks**:
   - While the **technical ideas** behind neural networks have existed for decades, recent advancements in **computing power** and data availability have made them much more effective 📈💡.

By applying these concepts, you can see how neural networks are **transforming industries** through both structured and unstructured data! 🚀
