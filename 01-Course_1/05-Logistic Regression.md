In this video, we cover the **logistic regression algorithm** 🤖, which is used for **binary classification** problems. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Binary Classification**: Given an input feature vector **X** (like an image 🖼️), the goal is to predict **Y hat** (the estimated probability that **Y = 1**, i.e., it's a cat 🐱 or not). We want **Y hat** to represent the **probability** between **0 and 1** 📉.

2. **Parameters**: The logistic regression model uses:
   - **W**: an X-dimensional vector 📐
   - **b**: a bias term (a real number) ➕

3. **Problem with Linear Function**: You might think to use **WᵀX + b** as the prediction, which works in linear regression, but it doesn't fit here as the output could be bigger than 1 or negative, which doesn't work for probabilities 🚫.

4. **Solution – Sigmoid Function**: Instead, we use the **sigmoid function** ⚙️:
   - **Y hat = sigmoid(WᵀX + b)**.
   - The **sigmoid function** smoothly maps the output between **0 and 1**.

   Here's how the **sigmoid function** behaves:
   - If **Z** (WᵀX + b) is large, **sigmoid(Z)** approaches **1** ☝️.
   - If **Z** is very negative, **sigmoid(Z)** approaches **0** 👇.

5. **Sigmoid Formula**: 
   - **Sigmoid(Z) = 1 / (1 + e⁻ᶻ)**.
   - For large **Z**, **sigmoid(Z)** is close to 1, and for very negative **Z**, it's close to 0 📊.

6. **Goal**: The objective is to **learn the parameters** **W** and **b** so that **Y hat** becomes a good estimate of the probability of **Y = 1** 🎯.

7. **Notational Differences**: Some courses use a notation where **X₀ = 1** is added as an extra feature, but in this course, we'll keep **W** and **b** separate, as it makes implementing neural networks easier 🧑‍💻. If you're unfamiliar with this, don't worry!
